            <p>This is my stockview project.</p>
            <p>Here are some introduction of the moving average lines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Moving average lines smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends in financial markets.</li>
                <li>They calculate averages of past prices to provide a clearer picture of market direction.</li>
                <li>Moving averages act as support and resistance levels, helping traders make informed decisions.</li>
                <li>Different types of moving averages, such as simple and exponential, are used.</li>
                <li>Combining different moving averages confirms trends and aids in finding entry and exit points.</li>
                <li>Moving averages are a simple yet effective tool for understanding market trends in technical analysis.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>When the moving average ribbons are parallel and evenly spaced, this means that the current trend is strong.
            </p>    
            <p>All the moving averages are in “agreement” since they are moving together.</p>    
            <p>
            The <span style = "color:#FFFF00">yellow</span>  period shows upward agreement indicating the stock is trending <b>upward</b> while the <span style = "color:#728FCE">blue</span> period indicates a <b>downward</b> trend.
